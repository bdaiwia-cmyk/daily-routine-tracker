Sample Software Requirements for Testing
=========================================

You can use these sample requirements to test the AI Coder system:

---

OPTION 1: Simple Calculator
----------------------------
Create a calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic operations
including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator
should handle invalid inputs gracefully and support decimal numbers. It should
also prevent division by zero errors.

OPTION 3: Temperature Converter
--------------------------------
Create a temperature conversion utility that converts between Celsius,
Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program should:
- Accept temperature input with a unit
- Convert to the other two units

---------------------------------
Build a program that analyzes text files and provides:
- Total word count
- Total character count
- Number of lines
- Most frequently used words (top 10)
- Average word length

The program should handle different text encodings and large files efficiently.
